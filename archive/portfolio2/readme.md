Welcome to my responsive portfolio readme

Note: Minor bug due to JS vh calculation script, when adjusting page size footer can position incorrectly, documented bug in notesNcommits  

I managed to get the navbar collapsing menu button working by adding the lines for linking javascript on bootstrap (took me a while to realise that was missing!)

Sticky footer was done using fluid containers (This gave me trouble in the first assignment)

I enjoyed making the page responsive and more crisp! Next assignment I will work on making commits regularly as I work
