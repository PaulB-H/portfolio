<h3>Dev by Paul - Redesign</h3>
<h4>www.devbypaul.ca</h4>
<p>Rebuilding my portfolio website</p>

<p>My last version, I limited my design by focusing too much on squeezing everything on to one screen on mobile, and creating a horizontal-scrolling layout.</p>

<p>This build will be a bit more "modern". I will make a vertical scroll design, so I can apply some nice on-scroll animations, which would not work on the horizontal scroll layout of the previous site.</p>

<p>I have a rough build done, I will be re-creating it piece by piece in this repo and cleaning up any in-line or unnecessary  styling.</p>
